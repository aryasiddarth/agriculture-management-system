# agriculture-management-system
JavaFX-based Agriculture Management prototype designed for farmers.
The Agriculture Management System (AMS) is a JavaFX-based application aimed at supporting farmers and government agencies by centralizing key agricultural services. The system enables farmer registration, real-time access to market data and weather forecasts, transparent resource distribution, two-way communication, and reporting capabilities. Each feature is modularly implemented through dedicated classes, with Main.java integrating them into a single user interface. This modular design supports efficient navigation and management, enabling farmers to access essential information and government agencies to distribute resources and monitor agricultural activities effectively.

The AMS application provides a streamlined solution to enhance agricultural management by consolidating essential services for farmers and agencies within a user-friendly interface. The modular architecture allows for future scalability, enabling more sophisticated features like live data integration, database storage, and real-time communication. Overall, AMS demonstrates the potential of technology to empower the agricultural sector, helping farmers make informed decisions while allowing agencies to manage resources efficiently and promote sustainable farming practices.
